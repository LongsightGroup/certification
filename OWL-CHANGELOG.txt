2012.03.19:
	-Modified pom.xml - rsmart's common-tool-lib is now in a provided scope so that we don't have to manually add the jar to our .m2/repository folders
2012.03.13:
	-The tool was only available to course sites. Just enabled the tool for project sites
	-Modified the user interface - removed any talk about ${} stuff
2012.03.12:
	-When editing the tool, the administrator couldn't switch the pdf file. They'd click 'browse' and select a pdf file, but it wouldn't actually change. I fixed this.
2012.03.08:
	-When configuring the tool, RSMART expected users to type in stuff that looks like "${}" into text fields. This will not do. So I replaced the text fields with dropdowns containing the description of the variables that are available, this completely hides the "${}" uglyness from the user
2012.03.06:
	-To date: 
		-checked out the tool from https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/rsmart/certification/
		-got it to build and fixed a few exceptions 
			-modified poms: 
				-changed the parent to point to base/org.sakaiproject rather than rsn-base/com.rsmart
				-added missing dependencies:
					-model/pom.xml - scheduler-events-model
					-tool/pom.xml - sakai-metaobj-tool-lib
		-updated CertificateDefinitionStatusEnumUserType.java: 
			-an import statement was pointing to a class that had changed packages
