	-[OWL-299] Now makes the session switch to admin temporarily to store the pdf in global resources. Works for instructors to create the templates and works for students to view their certificates
	-[OWL-322] Switched checkboxes to radiobuttons
2012.08.31:
	-[OWL-311] Removed the expiry offset from the first page
2012.08.30:
	-[OWL-311] Created the criterion for expiration dates some specified # of months after the last time the user was graded on a specified gradebook item
2012.08.28:
	-[OWL-311] Swapped pages 2 and 3
	-[OWL-303] Changed the logic, made some messages prettier (but this will need revision)
2012.08.27:
	-[OWL-297] Replaced the unique constraint on CertificateDefinition names with a unique constraint on both CertificateDefinition names & siteIds
	-[OWL-310] Replaced the lowercase "k" with uppercase in the delete confirmation for the "OK" button
	-[OWL-305] Removed all instances of the save progress button and the corresponding source code.
	-[OWL-304] Removed the next button on the fourth page
	-[OWL-309] Replaced 'Print' with 'View' in 3 places -> once as mentioned in the ticket, once in the page title, and once in a link to the page
2012.08.23:
	-Replaced all methods using Spring's @Resource and @Autowired annotation with methods containing ComponentManager calls. Tomcat shuts down properly now. #SpringIsAWasteOfTime
2012.08.20:
	-Applied a patch from RSmart that resolves a few issues in hibernate
2012.03.29:
	- [OWL-152] added ability to specify expiry offset in certificate definition
2012.03.19:
	-Modified pom.xml - rsmart's common-tool-lib is now in a provided scope so that we don't have to manually add the jar to our .m2/repository folders
	-CertificateDefinition.setDescription() called .trim() which could cause a null pointer exception, so we check this now
2012.03.13:
	-The tool was only available to course sites. Just enabled the tool for project sites
	-Modified the user interface - removed any talk about ${} stuff
2012.03.12:
	-When editing the tool, the administrator couldn't switch the pdf file. They'd click 'browse' and select a pdf file, but it wouldn't actually change. I fixed this.
2012.03.08:
	-When configuring the tool, RSMART expected users to type in stuff that looks like "${}" into text fields. This will not do. So I replaced the text fields with dropdowns containing the description of the variables that are available, this completely hides the "${}" uglyness from the user
2012.03.06:
	-To date: 
		-checked out the tool from https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/rsmart/certification/
		-got it to build and fixed a few exceptions 
			-modified poms: 
				-changed the parent to point to base/org.sakaiproject rather than rsn-base/com.rsmart
				-added missing dependencies:
					-model/pom.xml - scheduler-events-model
					-tool/pom.xml - sakai-metaobj-tool-lib
		-updated CertificateDefinitionStatusEnumUserType.java: 
			-an import statement was pointing to a class that had changed packages
